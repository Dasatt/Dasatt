Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Oluyemisi Oladayo Akinboboye 



I'm an instrumentation, control and automation engineering currently developing and expanding my skills in software manual and automation testing.
I'm learning Test Automation at Testify Academy and looking for opportunities to collaborate part time on project that will help hone my testing skills.
I'm a quick learner, able to adapt to changing environments quickly and I do pay keen attention to details.
